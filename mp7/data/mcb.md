As an MCB major, Einstein gets very into biology and ends up creating a human robot cyborg. He befriends it but now what should he do with it. Destroy it, make some more and rule the world, ignore it and let it roam the world freely.

#mcb-robot
uh-oh... robots ruling the world?

#mcb-continue
He continues his life
