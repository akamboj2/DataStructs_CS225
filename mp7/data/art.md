Wow Einstein ends up loving art! Why was he wasting his life before with something like physics when we live in a world of such rich art history. What should he do to promote art? Go back to his home school and try to revoke his degree and promote art intead, Cut himself off from society and just make art for the rest of his being, try something else maybe there's more he like's in this world.
