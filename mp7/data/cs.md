Oooops after taking CS 225 he realizes CS was the wrong life choice. What should he do now? Give up on life, try another major, suck it up and continue CS?
#cs-sadend
He leaves the universe and is never seen again.

#cs-uiuc
He goes back to choose another major

#cs-continue
He finishes cs and continues on with his life
